# Bing Search Bot

Use Robot and Selenium to do quick hits of the Bing search page in order to amass points so I can get Amazon bucks.

## Future Improvements:

* Find a more elegant way to add search terms instead of using a long static initializer
* Remove hard-coded strings and use properties
* Schedule application to run at a specified time each day
